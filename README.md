Cyclistic Analysis
This is the documentation for Google Data analyst Capstone project as the part of itâ€™s class courses. This case study will focus on analyzing the Cylistic Company, a company that focused on bike sharing program. There are 6 steps of analysis that will be performed: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

Background
	Cyclistic is a bike-sharing program that was formed in 2016 and has rapidly grown into a fleet of geo-tracked bikes integrated into the Chicago station network. The bikes can be unlocked at any station in the system and then returned to any other station at any time.
Cyclistic's marketing approach has been to raise public awareness and attract a wide variety of consumers. One-way tickets, full-day passes, and annual memberships were among its various pricing options. Regular riders are those who purchase single-day or multiple-ride tickets; Cyclistic members are those who purchase annual memberships.
My Role: For this scenario, I was assigned as a junior data analyst at Cyclistic with other data analyst team.
